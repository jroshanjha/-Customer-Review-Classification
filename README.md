# ðŸ’¬ Sentiment Analysis System â€“ Customer Review Classification

Objective: Analyze customer reviews and classify them as positive or negative.
I have download dataset from Kaggle
ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing:
Removed white spaces, punctuation, and stop words to clean and normalize textual data.

Handled case normalization and noise reduction for better token consistency.

# ðŸ§  Text Processing & Feature Engineering:
Utilized NLTK for tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.

Applied Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into meaningful numerical feature vectors.

# ðŸ¤– Model Training:
Trained various ML models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM for sentiment prediction.

Compared model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

# ðŸ“ˆ Results:
Achieved high classification accuracy in distinguishing between positive and negative reviews.

Demonstrated effectiveness of feature engineering and preprocessing in improving model performance.
